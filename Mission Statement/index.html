			Our mission is to design a game to educate children about survival skills in different scenarios. 

			Children nowadays live rather sheltered lives and majority lack the knowledge of basic survival skills. This lack will result in children not being able to protect themselves and survive in the event that they are in a dangerous situation. In our daily lives, we are rarely put in a situation where our safety is threatened, so gaining first-hand experiences are nearly impossible. Therefore, learning through a game would be a fun and attractive way to teach children survival skills.
